# Sarcastify

I wanted to challenge myself to write something with the following constraints:
- No Javascript build system (Webpack, etc.)
- No CSS framework (Bootstrap, Bulma, whatever)
- Does one thing
- Makes me laugh
- Takes less than a few hours

And thus...a portal back to 2002 AOL Instant Messenger humor.

## Quickstart
1. Pull down this repo
2. Either open `sarcastify.html` directly in a browser, or stand up a quick HTTP server via [one of these suggestions](https://gist.github.com/willurd/5720255)
3. Laugh
